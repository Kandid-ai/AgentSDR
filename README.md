## Why AgentSDR

Outbound usually means stitching together a lead database, an enrichment tool, an email sequencer, a LinkedIn tool, a dialer and a CRM, each with its own seats, its own copy of your leads and its own idea of who replied. Most of them are thin layers over APIs you could call yourself.

- **One workspace instead of six tools.** One record per person and company, so a reply on LinkedIn shows up in the same queue and pipeline as an email reply.
- **The AI does the tracking.** Every reply, on every channel, is read, classified and given a drafted answer. You approve what goes out.
- **You own it.** A single Next.js app and one PostgreSQL database on your own server. Your leads, conversations and recordings never leave infrastructure you control.
- **Your keys, no seats.** Connect your own Google Workspace, Unipile, storage and any AI model on OpenRouter. No per-seat or per-contact fees: you pay your server and your providers.

<a id="quick-start"></a>

## Get started

You need a server with Docker. Generate each secret with `openssl rand -hex 32`.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Kandid-ai/AgentSDR.git && cd AgentSDR
cp .env.example .env          # fill in the required values
docker compose up -d          # PostgreSQL, schema, the app on :3000, the scheduler
```

Open the app and sign up: the first account and organization become the instance's operator. Then connect your services in **Settings**.

The [Docker Compose guide](https://docs.agentsdr.ai/self-hosting/docker-compose) walks through every value in `.env` and every service. There are also guides for [running from source](https://docs.agentsdr.ai/self-hosting/from-source), [deploying on a VPS with Dokploy](https://docs.agentsdr.ai/self-hosting/dokploy) and [going to production](https://docs.agentsdr.ai/self-hosting/production).

<details>
<summary><b>Run it from source</b></summary>
<br>

You need [Bun](https://bun.sh) 1.2+ and PostgreSQL 16+.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Kandid-ai/AgentSDR.git && cd AgentSDR
bun install
createdb agentsdr
cp .env.example .env.local   # set DATABASE_URL, BETTER_AUTH_SECRET, INTEGRATION_CREDENTIALS_KEY
bun run db:setup             # create the schema in the empty database
bun run db:seed:demo         # optional: a fictional demo organization
bun run dev                  # http://localhost:3000
```

With the demo seed, sign in as `demo@example.com` / `demo-password-123`.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Environment variables</b></summary>
<br>

Environment variables cover only what the app needs before it can read its database. Everything else is per organization, in the app.

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | yes | PostgreSQL 16+ connection string |
| `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` | yes | Signs sessions |
| `BETTER_AUTH_URL` | yes | Public URL, read at runtime |
| `INTEGRATION_CREDENTIALS_KEY` | yes | Encrypts integration credentials (AES-256-GCM) |
| `UNSUBSCRIBE_SECRET` | for email | Signs unsubscribe links |
| `CRON_SECRET`, `OUTREACH_TICK_SECRET` | for jobs | Authenticate scheduled-job calls |
| `RESEND_API_KEY`, `AUTH_EMAIL_FROM` | in production | Auth email through Resend |
| `AUTH_SIGNUP` | no | `invite-only` (default) or `open` |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | no | "Continue with Google" |
| `DB_POOL_MAX` | no | Connection pool size (default 8) |

Every variable, with how to generate it and where it is read: [Configuration reference](https://docs.agentsdr.ai/configuration).

```

One Next.js app and one PostgreSQL database: pages, API routes and background workers run in a single process, with no queue server or Redis. Every request, job and webhook runs inside one organization's scope, and code that forgets fails closed. Integration credentials are encrypted per organization and verified with a live call before they are saved. More in [How it works](https://docs.agentsdr.ai/how-it-works) and the [architecture guide](https://docs.agentsdr.ai/architecture).

| `bun run db:check` | Audit that every table is organization-scoped |

CI runs typecheck, lint, tests, a secret scan, the production build, the extension build and a fresh install on PostgreSQL 16, 17 and 18. See the [development guide](https://docs.agentsdr.ai/development).

**Built with** [Next.js 16](https://nextjs.org) and React 19, TypeScript, [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team), [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) with [AlignUI](https://www.alignui.com), and [Bun](https://bun.sh).

## Security and privacy

- **Your data stays with you.** Leads, conversations and analytics live in your PostgreSQL; call recordings in your own R2 bucket, reached only through short-lived signed links.
- **Encrypted credentials.** Every saved API key and token is encrypted with AES-256-GCM.
- **Tenant isolation, tested.** An end-to-end suite signs in as a second organization and proves it can see, change and count nothing of the first.
- **Humans approve outbound replies.** AI drafts wait for a person, and outbound work can be paused instantly.
- **Report vulnerabilities privately** through [GitHub security advisories](https://github.com/Kandid-ai/AgentSDR/security/advisories/new). See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Responsible use

AgentSDR contacts people on your behalf, so how it is used is your responsibility. LinkedIn's terms do not allow automation and accounts can be restricted; WhatsApp bans numbers that send unsolicited bulk messages; cold email is regulated by laws such as CAN-SPAM, GDPR and CASL; and many places require consent before a call is recorded. Sending limits, unsubscribe links and Do Not Contact reduce the risk but do not make any use compliant. Read [Responsible use](https://docs.agentsdr.ai/responsible-use) before you start.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>Is AgentSDR free?</b></summary>

Yes. It is open source and you host it yourself, so there are no seats, tiers or per-contact fees. You pay for your server, the accounts you connect (Google Workspace, Unipile) and your own AI usage. It is MIT-licensed, so you can also use, change and build on it commercially.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Which email providers can it send from?</b></summary>

Google Workspace mailboxes, connected once through a service account with domain-wide delegation. Each mailbox has its own daily limit (30 by default), sending hours and signature. Microsoft 365 is not supported yet.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Will LinkedIn automation get my account restricted?</b></summary>

No tool can promise that, but AgentSDR stays well inside LinkedIn's limits: 30 invitations a day on premium accounts and 5 on free, a random 30 to 60 second gap between invitations, optional working hours per account, and an account that hits LinkedIn's own limit pauses for the day.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How does WhatsApp calling work?</b></summary>

You link your number through Unipile and install the AgentSDR Call Recorder Chrome extension. When you call a lead from AgentSDR, the extension dials inside WhatsApp Web and records both sides; the recording goes to your storage bucket and your chosen model transcribes it. It relies on WhatsApp Web's English interface.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Which AI models can I use?</b></summary>

Any model on OpenRouter, with your own key. Each call is pinned to the provider you picked, with fallbacks turned off, so your data only goes where you chose.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Does the AI send replies on its own?</b></summary>

No. Drafts, including follow-up sequence steps, wait in *Action required* until someone sends them, as written or edited. The AI can move a lead forward in the pipeline when it is confident; anything else is held for a person.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can my whole team use it?</b></summary>

Yes. Invite teammates from Settings → Members with the owner, admin or member role. One deployment can also hold several organizations, each fully separate.
