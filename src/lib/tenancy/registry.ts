/**
 * Which tables belong to an organization, and how. The one list that the
 * scope migration (scripts/add-organization-scope.ts), the scope audit
 * (scripts/check-organization-scope.ts) and the isolation tests all read, so
 * they cannot disagree. Pure data — safe to import anywhere.
 *
 * A table is here when it holds an organization's data and either has no
 * NOT NULL path to a scoped parent, or is read often enough without its
 * parent that filtering it directly matters. Tables not listed are either
 * children that inherit scope through a NOT NULL foreign key to a listed
 * table (they are named in `INHERITED`), or genuinely global (`GLOBAL`).
 *
 * Live-only legacy tables with no code (crm_linkedin_*, campaign_members,
 * crm_lead_events, _category_map, the channel audit) are
 * deliberately left alone: nothing reads or writes them.
