/**
 * WhatsApp messaging through Unipile: the shapes the API, the UI and the
 * webhook share. Pure types and constants — safe to import from client
 * components.
 *
 * How it fits together:
 *   - A rep links their WhatsApp number in the Unipile dashboard. AgentSDR
 *     reads the linked numbers from Unipile (accounts.ts, "Sync") into
 *     whatsapp_accounts — separately from the LinkedIn accounts, which read
 *     only type LINKEDIN.
 *   - Unipile posts every message on those numbers to
 *     /api/webhooks/whatsapp-message: replies from leads, and echoes of what
 *     the rep sent — from AgentSDR or straight from their phone. Each lands in
 *     whatsapp_chats / whatsapp_messages (the Messages tab), and, for a lead
 *     AgentSDR knows by phone, in the CRM on a "whatsapp" conversation, like
 *     LinkedIn replies do.
 *   - AgentSDR sends through Unipile (POST /api/whatsapp/send): into the
 *     existing chat with that number, or a new one.
 *
 * Calls stay with the call-recorder extension on web.whatsapp.com; Unipile
 * has no calling API.
