/**
 * AI calling campaigns: a calling campaign whose calls the AI agent places
 * by itself, from cloud calling stations, following a sequence — the shapes
 * the API, the pages and the engine share. Client-safe and import-free.
 *
 * A campaign is a call_campaigns row with run_by = 'ai'. Its leads are the
 * usual call_campaign_contacts, with the ai_* columns holding where each
 * stands. Two sequences:
 *
 *   steps        reach them: AI calls and WhatsApp messages, each after a
 *                delay, run only while the lead has not had a real
 *                conversation. Picking up and saying nothing does not count.
 *   chaseSteps   they said yes to a meeting but have not booked: after the
 *                call a WhatsApp with the booking link goes out, then these
 *                run until Cal.com reports a booking, they reply, or the
 *                steps run out (then a person takes over).
 *
 * After a real conversation the agent's outcome (record_outcome) decides
 * what happens; see AI_OUTCOME_ROUTES and engineRules.ts.
