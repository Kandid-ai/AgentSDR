/**
 * The organization's calling instructions: how the AI agent runs a WhatsApp
 * call — its opening, the shape of the call, how it talks — edited as titled
 * blocks on Settings → Instructions → Calling (crm_settings.calling_instructions,
 * beside the reply drafting and classification instructions). Null there means
 * these defaults, so an organization that never opens the tab gets them.
 *
 * What is NOT here stays fixed in liveAgent.ts, because the calling system
 * depends on it: who the agent is (its name, the Hindi grammar of its voice),
 * being honest that it is an AI, the campaign's goal, recording the outcome
 * and hanging up, and following "[Call note:" messages.
 *
 * Placeholders: {{agentName}} and {{firstName}} ("there" when unknown).
 * Client-safe and import-free, so the settings page shows the same defaults.

No pitch yet. Then stop and let them answer.",
