 * lead's audio to the model and plays the model's voice into the call as the
 * microphone (see extensions/whatsapp-recorder/src/live-agent.ts).
 *
 * The browser never sees the API key: this mints a single-use ephemeral token
 * with the whole session — model, voice, instructions, tools — locked into
 * it, so the extension's own setup message cannot change any of it.
 *
 * TRIAL EXCEPTION to two standing rules, on the owner's instruction (11 Oct
 * 2026): the key is read from GEMINI_API_KEY rather than a per-organization
 * integration, and the model is called directly rather than through the
 * OpenRouter BYOK runtime (OpenRouter has no realtime audio API). Move the
 * key into an organization integration before this leaves the trial.
