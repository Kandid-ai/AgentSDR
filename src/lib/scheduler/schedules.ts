 *   organization (the job's own code iterates organizations).
 * - The daily rollover, once per organization at the start of that
 *   organization's day (Settings → Organization → Time zone / New day starts
 *   at): builds its email queues, renews its Gmail watches, resets its
 *   LinkedIn daily limits. Its claim key is `daily-rollover:<organization id>`.

 * All times are UTC unless a job names a zone.
