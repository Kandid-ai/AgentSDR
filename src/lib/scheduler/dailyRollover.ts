/**
 * The daily rollover: once per organization, at the start of that
 * organization's day (Settings → Organization → Time zone and New day starts
 * at, stored with the other organization defaults in channel_settings), it
 *
 *   a. builds the organization's email send queues (buildQueue.ts),
 *   b. renews its mailboxes' Gmail push watches (mailboxWatch.ts),
 *   c. resets its LinkedIn accounts' daily limits (resetDailyLimits).
 *
 * Its slot is the instant the organization's current day began, so a
 * claim key is (`daily-rollover:<organization id>`, that instant) — DST-safe,
 * and a late run still belongs to the right day.
 *
 * Changing the time zone or the time: the claim is also refused when the
 * organization's previous rollover STARTED at or after the new day's start
 * (claims.ts). A rollover that already happened inside the current day, as
 * the new setting counts days, therefore stands, and the next one is at the
 * next new-day time. The one case a change does produce two rollovers within
 * 24 hours is moving the day start LATER (or east-to-west): the old day's
 * rollover already ran, and the new day boundary still lies ahead today, so
 * that is a genuinely new day under the new setting.
