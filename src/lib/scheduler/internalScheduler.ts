/**
 * The scheduled jobs, run inside the app (replacing the cron container):
 * the platform jobs in schedules.ts and each organization's daily rollover
 * (dailyRollover.ts). Started once from instrumentation.ts in production;
 * INTERNAL_SCHEDULER=false turns it off.
 *
 * Every TICK_MS it works out each job's latest due slot (slots.ts) and tries
 * to claim it in scheduled_job_runs (claims.ts); only the claimer runs it. So
 * a slot runs once across restarts, overlapping instances during a deploy,
 * and external cron calls to the same jobs' endpoints. After downtime only
 * the latest missed slot runs. Platform jobs run concurrently with each
 * other, but a job never overlaps itself in this process: while it runs its
 * new slots wait, and the latest one is claimed when it finishes. Rollovers
 * run one organization at a time.
 *
 * A job with no recorded run at all (the first start after this was
 * deployed, or a brand-new organization) does not run a slot that began
 * before this process started: on an install that used to run these from an
 * external cron, today's daily work has already been done by it, and rerunning
 * a LinkedIn daily reset mid-day would grant a second day's allowance. Its
 * first run is its next slot.
 *
 * Without the scheduled_job_runs table nothing runs (one loud warning): with
 * no claims it could not tell a restart from a new slot, nor itself from an
 * external cron, and would repeat daily resets. It starts working within a
 * tick of the migration being applied, no restart needed.
