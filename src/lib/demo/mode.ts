/**
 * The public demo: a deployment with DEMO_MODE=true lets anyone browse the
 * app with no sign-in, read-only, on a database holding only the fictional
 * organization from scripts/db/seed-demo.ts.
 *
 * - A visitor without a session goes to /demo, which signs them in as the
 *   demo user (src/app/demo/route.ts). The sign-in screens redirect there too.
 * - Every mutating request is refused in the proxy (demoRequestBlock), so
 *   nothing a visitor clicks changes the data another visitor sees.
 * - Nothing runs in the background (src/instrumentation.ts), and there is no
 *   cron: the demo never sends, syncs or calls a model.
 *
 * Never set DEMO_MODE on a deployment whose database holds real data: every
 * visitor is signed in as the demo user with no password.
 *
 * Imported by the proxy, so it must stay free of server-only imports.
