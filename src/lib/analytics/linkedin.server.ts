/**
 * LinkedIn view. Five queries, at most three in flight (runLimited):
 *  1. "Message" (canonical rows only): invites, outbound messages, distinct messaged and
 *     replied leads for both periods, plus a per-day split (the GROUPING SETS total row
 *     has `total = true`).
 *  2. Accepted connections, same shape. An acceptance is timestamped
 *     COALESCE(Lead.acceptMessageSentAt, Connection.connectedAt): acceptMessageSentAt is
 *     set on every processed acceptance, with or without acceptance text
 *     (acceptanceMessage.ts), but only when the worker gets to the lead, so a
 *     connection the worker has not reached yet still counts via connectedAt (set by the
 *     connection-accepted webhook). One timestamp per lead, so a lead counts once.
 *  3. Accounts now.
 *  4. Campaigns with lead counts (all time).
 *  5. Invites per campaign per day (Lead.requestSentAt) for sentInRange ordering and trend.
 *
 * Replied is distinct leads with a RECEIVED message. The per-day series counts distinct
 * leads per day and buckets sum those, so in weekly mode a lead replying on two days
 * counts twice in the chart; the KPI and funnel use the true distinct count.
 *
 * Indexes that would help at scale: "Message" (type, createdAt), "Lead" (requestSentAt).
