/**
 * Email view. Six queries, at most three in flight (runLimited):
 *  1. outreach_emails: sent / contacted / failed for both periods plus a per-day split
 *     (GROUPING SETS: the `d IS NULL` row is the total, the others are days).
 *  2. crm_conversation_messages: inbound email replies from people enrolled in an email
 *     campaign — rows per day and distinct people for both periods.
 *  3. outreach_suppression_list: bounced / unsubscribed for both periods.
 *  4. campaigns with lead-status counts (all time).
 *  5. sends per campaign per day in the range (feeds sentInRange and the trend).
 *  6. mailboxes now.
 *
 * Indexes that would help at scale: outreach_emails (status, sent_at),
 * crm_conversation_messages (channel, direction, sent_at).
