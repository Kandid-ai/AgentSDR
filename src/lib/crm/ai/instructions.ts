/**
 * Workspace-written instructions for the CRM's AI (crm_settings.draft_instructions
 * and .classification_instructions, edited on CRM Settings).
 *
 * Each is a list of titled blocks ("Tone", "Who we are", "Pricing rules"),
 * stored as jsonb and rendered into one Markdown section per block.
 *
 * They go into the system prompt, after the fixed rules, because they come from
 * the people running the CRM — unlike profile, message and Knowledge text, which
 * the prompts treat as untrusted data. The fixed rules still win: instructions
 * shape tone and judgement, they cannot make the model send, invent facts,
 * leave the taxonomy or break the output format.
 *
 * Kept free of runtime imports so the settings UI can share the types and caps.
