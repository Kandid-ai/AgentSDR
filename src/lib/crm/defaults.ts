/**
 * The CRM an organization starts with: one default pipeline, its settings row
 * and the reply taxonomy (subcategories only — the sequences scripts/
 * seed-crm-response-taxonomy.ts writes are one company's copy, so a new
 * organization writes its own).
 *
 * Created lazily, on the first thing that needs "the default pipeline", so
 * nothing depends on a sign-up hook having run. Idempotent and race-safe: the
 * per-organization unique index crm_pipelines_org_one_default_uq arbitrates,
 * and the pipeline, settings and taxonomy commit together, so a caller that
 * loses the race sees the finished set. Subcategories are seeded only by the
 * call that creates the pipeline, so ones an operator later deletes stay gone.
