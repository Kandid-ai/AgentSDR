/**
 * Every prompt AgentSDR writes itself, by its Langfuse name. An
 * organization's Langfuse project holds its live versions (label
 * "production"); these copies are what saving the integration uploads
 * (src/lib/observability/langfusePrompts.ts) and what a call uses when the
 * organization has not connected Langfuse or it cannot be reached. Names are
 * "<area>/<what>", which Langfuse shows as folders.
 *
 * Only prompts written in code live here. What organizations write (CRM and
 * calling instructions, knowledge, campaign instructions) stays in the
 * database and reaches a prompt as a variable.
 *
 * Pure text and import-free beyond the domain lists, so client code may read it.
