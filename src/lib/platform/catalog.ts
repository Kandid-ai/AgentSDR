 * page of the channel it powers (PLATFORM_SETTINGS_HREF), and a feature works
 * only while its integration is connected. None of them is read from env.
 *
 * Not to be confused with `src/lib/integrations`, the enrichment providers a
 * grid column calls per row (any number of accounts each). OpenRouter is not
 * here either: it has its own connection flow under `src/lib/ai`
 * (Settings → AI provider).
 *
