// POST /api/outreach/build-queue — rebuilds today's per-mailbox send queue:
// wipes yesterday's leftovers, resets daily send counters (idempotent per
// mailbox-local day — safe to call more than once), then fills each
// connected mailbox's queue with due follow-ups first (most-overdue and
// deepest-into-sequence first), and brand-new leads round-robin filling
// whatever capacity is left over. Matches AgentSDR-app's
// make-mailbox-queues cron.
//
// The in-process scheduler already does this for each organization at the
// start of its day (the daily rollover, src/lib/scheduler/dailyRollover.ts).
// This endpoint remains for a manual run or an external cron: while the
// scheduler runs it skips organizations that already rolled over today
// (`?force=1` rebuilds them anyway). Shared-secret auth, like /api/outreach/tick.
