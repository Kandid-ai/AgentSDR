/**
 * POST /api/webhooks/whatsapp-message?secret=… — Unipile's messaging webhook
 * for the linked WhatsApp numbers (events message_received, message_read,
 * message_delivered). Public in proxy.ts, so it checks the notify secret
 * stored with the Unipile integration (?secret= or x-unipile-secret) itself.
 * The payload's account_id names the organization that linked the number;
 * the secret checked is that organization's, and everything after runs in
 * its scope.
 *
 * Every delivery is written raw to the webhook ledger (WebhookEvent — the
 * LinkedIn webhooks page shows it, account type WHATSAPP) before anything
 * else, which also collapses Unipile's retries. Unipile retries non-2xx and
 * gives up after 30 s, so the answer is 200 as soon as the delivery is
 * recorded; it is processed after the response (next/server `after`), and
 * the outcome lands on the ledger row. Only a failure to record answers 500,
 * so Unipile retries.
