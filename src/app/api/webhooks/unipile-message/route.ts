 * POST /api/webhooks/unipile-message?org=… — the one Unipile messaging
 * webhook AgentSDR registers (src/lib/platform/unipileWebhooks.ts), for
 * events message_received, message_read and message_delivered.
 *
 * Unipile sends messaging events for every connected account, whatever the
 * provider, so this only routes by `account_type`: WhatsApp to the WhatsApp
 * handler, a LinkedIn message_received to the LinkedIn one. Each handler
 * does its own gate, secret check and ledger write, exactly as when it is
 * called at its own path — those paths stay live for hand-made
 * registrations and the LinkedIn replay job. Anything else (a LinkedIn read
 * or delivery receipt, another provider) is acknowledged and dropped before
 * it reaches the ledger. Public in proxy.ts.
