 * WhatsApp Calling pages share the LinkedIn section's padded, scrolling

 * Not gated on Unipile: calls go through WhatsApp Web (the rep's own, or a
 * calling station's), and a station's number also messages without Unipile.
 * What still needs Unipile (syncing Unipile numbers) says so where it is used.
