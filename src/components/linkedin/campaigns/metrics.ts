 * What a LinkedIn campaign's lead-status counts add up to. Every figure on
 * the list and detail pages comes from here, so the two can't disagree.
 *
 * A lead's status is where it is now, not a history, so the cumulative
 * stages are sums of every status at or past them:
 * - accepted: connected, messaged, any follow-up, completed or replied
 * - invited: accepted plus those still waiting on the invitation
 *
 * Reply rate is replied / accepted — the same definition as the LinkedIn
 * view on Analytics — because a lead can only reply once connected.
