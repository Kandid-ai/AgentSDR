/**
 * Shade, the AgentSDR mascot, as pixel data. Pure — no React, no CSS — so
 * the Mascot component, the static icon files (src/app/icon.svg,
 * apple-icon.png, the recorder extension's PNGs) and the launch video all
 * draw from this one source. Redraw them together if a frame changes here.
 *
 * '#' is a filled pixel. Every frame is 12 pixels wide and stands on the
 * floor at y = 11, so a taller frame rises instead of sinking; `dx` shifts a
 * frame sideways. VIEWBOX leaves a pixel of room for both.
