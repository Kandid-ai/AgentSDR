/**
 * This database is shared with the linkedin-automation-next platform, which
 * manages its own tables through Prisma. Without a filter, drizzle-kit diffs
 * our schema against EVERY table in the database, sees Prisma's as unknown,
 * and offers to drop them — including _prisma_migrations, which is that
 * platform's entire migration history.
 *
 * This is an allowlist rather than a blocklist on purpose: a new Prisma table
 * added tomorrow is protected automatically, whereas a blocklist would have to
 * be updated by someone who remembered this constraint existed.
 *
 * Keep in sync with the pgTable() names in src/lib/**\/schema.ts.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * DO NOT ADD THE LEAD DATABASE TABLES HERE
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `people`, `companies`, `entity_columns` and `import_runs` are absent on
 * purpose, breaking the "every snake_case table
 * goes in the allowlist" rule in CLAUDE.md.
 *
 * `people` and `companies` gain columns at RUNTIME — the column settings UI
 * runs ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN (src/lib/leads/columns.ts). Their Drizzle
 * definitions describe the core columns only and are structurally incomplete
 * by design. Listing them here would make drizzle-kit read that partial
 * definition as the truth, see every user-added column as drift, and offer to
 * DROP it — silently destroying user data on the next `push`.
 *
 * The other two are excluded so the rule stays one sentence: the lead database
 * is hand-maintained through scripts/create-lead-tables.ts, exactly like the
 * ex-Prisma LinkedIn tables.
