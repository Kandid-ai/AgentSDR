/**
 * One-shot backfill: records each Person's already-sent outreach (the
 * initial email/LinkedIn pitch and any follow-ups) as outbound
 * crm_conversation_messages on their existing CRM conversation.
 *
 * src/lib/crm/outreachHistory.ts now does this inline from
 * ingestInboundReplyInTransaction for every new reply, so this script only
 * matters for conversations that were created before that landed — without
 * it, their classifier/drafter context starts at the reply with no memory
 * of what was pitched.
 *
 * Idempotent — safe to re-run. Every insert goes through the same
 * insertConversationMessageInTransaction upsert the live path uses, so a
 * conversation that already has some or all of this history is left alone
 * for the rows that already exist.
 *
 * Run with: bun --conditions=react-server scripts/backfill-crm-outreach-history.ts
 * (conversations.ts reaches a `server-only` import, so the flag is required.)
 * Bun loads .env.local automatically; override DATABASE_URL if that file
 * points at a retired host.
 *
 * Runs in ORGANIZATION_ID, or the initial organization when it is unset.
