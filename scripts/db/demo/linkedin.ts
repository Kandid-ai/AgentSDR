/**
 * Northwind's LinkedIn outbound: three connected accounts, three campaigns
 * with their leads walked through the invitation / acceptance / follow-up
 * sequence, the Messages inbox (a Connection + its Message rows), replies
 * handed to the CRM, a lived-in network of other connections, two completed
 * search batches, the platform job history and the webhook ledger.
 *
 * LinkedIn has no invitation or conversation tables, so a story is told with
 * the same rows the engine writes: Lead.requestSentAt + an INVITATION Message,
 * a Connection (chatId) once accepted, and ACCEPTANCE / FOLLOW_UP_n / RECEIVED /
 * CUSTOM_SENT Messages on it. Everything is inserted directly (the engine would
 * stamp "now" and call Unipile); replies reach the CRM through the same
 * `ingestInboundReply` the webhook uses, after the outbound rows exist, so its
 * outreach-history backfill copies the pitch into the conversation with the
 * right timestamps.
