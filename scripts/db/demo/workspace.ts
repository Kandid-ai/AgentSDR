/**
 * The demo's workspace: Tables (folders, workbooks, sheets with finished
 * enrichment runs) and Prospecting (the global storefront dataset plus the
 * qualification campaigns that were run over it).
 *
 * Nothing here calls a provider. Enrichment, AI, HTTP and formula cells are
 * written the way the grid worker leaves them after a successful run: the
 * value, `cellMeta` {status: "success", outcome, provider, costCents, runAt}
 * and an audit row in grid_cell_runs. No grid_jobs row exists, so the grid
 * never starts polling, and no qualification job is left running, so the
 * campaign page never restarts one.
