/**
 * The CRM half of the demo: Settings → Knowledge / Instructions / Lead
 * categories, the reply sequences, and then (after the channel modules have
 * ingested the leads' replies) everything that happened to those replies —
 * AI classifications, human corrections, drafts, sent replies, follow-ups,
 * stage moves, closed records.
 *
 * Nothing here calls out. Classification and drafting run through the app's
 * real handlers (`handleClassificationJob`, `generateDraftForStep`,
 * `generateFallbackDraft`, `applyHumanClassification`, `moveRecordStage`,
 * `sendDraft`, ...) with a FAKE model that returns the text written below, and
 * sending goes through a stub adapter that returns a provider-looking result.
 *
 * Time. Those helpers stamp rows with the real clock. So every step runs in a
 * "phase": take a database-clock marker, run the operation, then rewrite
 * everything the record gained since the marker (events, classifications,
 * drafts, runs, step runs, send attempts, outbound messages, ...) to the moment
 * the step should have happened. `crm_events` and `crm_conversation_messages`
 * have append-only triggers, so the rewrite runs in a transaction with
 * `SET LOCAL session_replication_role = replica`, which switches triggers
 * (and so also the validation triggers, whose conditions the lib calls just
 * satisfied) off for that transaction only. That needs a superuser, which the
 * local demo database and the deployed demo's dedicated Postgres both have.
 * Nothing here may ever run against a database holding real data.

Annual contracts get 15% off. For {company} I'd expect Team to be the fit, and we can start with a two-seat, 14-day pilot on one campaign before anyone commits to anything.",
  integration:
    "Northwind Signal syncs with HubSpot and Salesforce (CRM sync is part of the Team plan) and runs fine next to a sequencer you already use. It decides who is worth contacting this week and why, then feeds that tool, so most customers keep the stack they have.",
  privacy:
    "Short version: we are SOC 2 Type II and every customer gets an isolated workspace, so your lead data is never mixed with anyone else's. I'll send the SOC 2 report and our DPA, and the standard security review usually takes about two weeks. Tell me who on your side runs it and I'll send them the pack directly.",
  onboarding:
    "Onboarding is mostly import and mapping: you upload your spreadsheets or sync your CRM, we map the fields once, and the first prioritised account list is usually ready within a few days. A large import is routine. The overview at northwind.example/signal-overview walks through the first two weeks.",
  comparison:
    "The main difference: a sequencing tool sends messages, while Northwind Signal decides who is worth messaging this week and why. It scores accounts against your ICP and hands the list to the tool you already have. The median customer books about 31% more first meetings in their first quarter.",
  generic:
    "In short, Northwind Signal pulls lead and company data together, scores accounts against your ICP and tells reps who to contact this week and why. Customers cut research time per account from about 25 minutes to under 5. The overview is at northwind.example/signal-overview.",
