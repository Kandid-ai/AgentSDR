/**
 * Records a WhatsApp Web call from inside the page. Runs in the page's own JS
 * world at document_start, before WhatsApp's code loads.
 *
 * What the probe established (29 Sep 2026): WhatsApp Web does not carry call
 * audio as WebRTC media tracks. Its own engine plays the other side through an
 * AudioWorklet connected to an AudioContext's destination, and reads the
 * microphone with getUserMedia — acquired when the call starts, stopped when
 * it ends, whoever hangs up. So the recording is assembled from exactly
 * those two points:
 *   - the other side: every node WhatsApp connects to a speaker destination
 *     is also connected into our recording graph (AudioNode.connect patch);
 *   - the rep: a clone of the call's microphone track.
 * Our graph lives in WhatsApp's own, already-running AudioContext, so
 * Chrome's autoplay policy never silences the recording.
 *
 * When: the recorder starts as soon as the call opens the microphone —
 * before the pick-up, so the lead's first words are never lost to the time it
 * takes to notice it. The pick-up is when the call timer appears; the timer
 * counts from it, so its reading dates the pick-up precisely even when it is
 * noticed a moment late. The recording stops when the timer disappears, End
 * call goes, or the microphone is released; a call never picked up is
 * discarded.
 *
 * Where: while its tab is in the background, WhatsApp moves the call UI into
 * a Document Picture-in-Picture window (seen 29 Sep 2026). So End call and
 * the timer are looked for in the page and that window, and a missing End
 * call must stay missing a few checks running — the hand-over between the
 * two must not read as a hang-up. A timer is a m:ss text near End call that changes — a voice
 * note's static "0:12" never ticks. If no timer shows within a minute of the
 * mic opening, recording starts anyway, in case WhatsApp's markup changed.
 *
 * Nothing is recorded unless wa-agent armed this tab for a call placed from
 * AgentSDR — the rep's own calls are never touched.
 *
 * An agent call (trial) is armed with `agent`: the AI voice agent talks
 * instead of the rep. WhatsApp's getUserMedia then gets a microphone track
 * that carries the agent's voice (a MediaStreamAudioDestinationNode) in place
 * of the real one, which is released at once; the lead's side, from the
 * pick-up on, goes to wa-agent as 16 kHz PCM for the model (live-agent.ts).
 * The rep hears both sides through the speakers, and the recording keeps the
 * agent left and the lead right, as it would the rep.
 *
 * A rep call (station mode) is armed with `remoteRep`: the rep talks from
 * their own AgentSDR tab, through this cloud browser. At arming, a WebRTC
 * peer connection answers the rep's tab's offer (non-trickle; the answer
 * goes to AgentSDR through wa-agent). The rep's voice arrives on it and
 * becomes WhatsApp's microphone, exactly as the agent's voice does; the
 * lead's side goes back to the rep from the moment WhatsApp dials. wa-agent
 * dials only once the link is up, and the link lost mid-call, or the rep's
 * hang-up on its data channel, presses End call. The recording keeps the
 * rep left and the lead right.
