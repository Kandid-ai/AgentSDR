/**
 * The AI voice agent's side of a call (trial): one Gemini Live session,
 * opened by wa-agent when an agent call starts ringing.
 *
 * Why here, in the isolated world: web.whatsapp.com's CSP (connect-src) only
 * lets the page reach WhatsApp's own hosts, so wa-hook, in the page's world,
 * cannot open this socket. Content scripts are not bound by the page's CSP.
 * Audio crosses between the two over window.postMessage as raw PCM:
 *   lead → model: wa-hook posts the lead's side at 16 kHz ("agent-audio");
 *   model → lead: the model's 24 kHz voice goes back to wa-hook
 *                 ("agent-play"), which plays it into the call's microphone.
 *
 * The session's setup — model, voice, instructions, tools — is locked into
 * the token AgentSDR mints (src/lib/calls/liveAgent.ts); the setup sent here
 * only names the model.
